# Project: RecipeHub (Full-Stack)


## Background

This project is a web-based recipe management application with user authentication and admin functionality. It allows users to view, add, update, and delete recipes, as well as search for specific recipes. Admins have additional capabilities to manage ingredients. The application uses a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front-end communicates with a backend API.

## Getting Started
- You will be working on the front end of this application.
- You can test your implementation by opening the HTML files in a browser and interacting with the UI.
- Ensure the backend is running if you are testing features that require the use of the backend. To run the backend, navigate to the `backend/src/main/java/com/revature/Main.java` file and run that file. The server will run on `http://localhost:8081/`. 
- If the backend is running, you cannot run tests simultaneously. Ensure the backend is stopped before you run your tests.
- You are encouraged to incorporate CSS however you'd like to provide styling for the application.
